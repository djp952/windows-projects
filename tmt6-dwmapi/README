ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre 6 Composition (Aero) Fix

This module, when placed in the same directory as the TMT6 applications, will
falsely report that Desktop Composition (Aero) is disabled.  This prevents
the application from requesting it to be shut down and eliminates a tearing
problem with DVD content on some systems.  The original 32-bit dwmapi.dll file
must be copied into the directory as well, and renamed as "dwmapi32.dll".

> Required system file location:
x86 - C:\Windows\System32\dwmapi.dll
x64 - C:\Windows\SysWOW64\dwmapi.dll

The original concept for this fix was provided by "DSP_Tom", a user on the
ArcSoft support forums (http://www.arcsoft.com/forum/default.asp).  The original
concept used function stubs rather than function forwarders.
